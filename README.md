## Purpose / Goal

I take the course to recap JavaScript basics and be familiar with some JS functions that will use frequently in the website.
Also, by taking this course, I expects to experience `WebSockets`, `SocketIO`, and `WebRTC`.  

At the end of the course, I am expected to build both front-end and back-end of a famous video conference application, [zoom](zoom.us).
