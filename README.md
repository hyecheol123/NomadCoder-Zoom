# NomadCoder-Zoom

Clone Coding Repository for "Zoom Clone Coding" Course of NomadCoder

Lecture Link: https://nomadcoders.co/noom

- Lecture language: English (Administrated in Korean)

## Purpose / Goal

I take the course to recap JavaScript basics and be familiar with some JS functions that will use frequently in the website.
Also, by taking this course, I expects to experience `WebSockets`, `SocketIO`, and `WebRTC`.

At the end of the course, I am expected to build both front-end and back-end of a famous video conference application, [zoom](zoom.us).

## What I Learn

- Basics of using [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html), the template engine, with [express](http://expressjs.com/).
- [MVP CSS](https://andybrewer.github.io/mvp/), making default design of HTML elements look better.
- Using [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) to automatically restart server when files changed.

## Project
